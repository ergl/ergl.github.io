* Reimplemented remote reads using TCP + separate processes (instead of putting the sockets in the coordinator)
** Sockets in coordinator cause overload (too many open sockets)
* Tested slightly on cloudlab, but it was too slow (//no op for//... error).
** Have to test again, with maybe more remote reader processes (100 right now)
