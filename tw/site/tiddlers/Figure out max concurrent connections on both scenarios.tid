title: Figure out max concurrent connections on both scenarios
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Depends much more greatly on the max number of ports (`ERL_MAX_PORTS`), that limits the number of open ports that the VM can have (each socket is a port). Linux could also be the limit, if we add more client machines. Test how to change that.
