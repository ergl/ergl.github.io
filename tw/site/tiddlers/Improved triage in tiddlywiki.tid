title: Improved triage in tiddlywiki
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* ~~Use fields, not tags~~
** Don't pollute tag space
* Allow `depends on ...`
* ~~More sections (backlog, etc)~~
** Could be changed to just have one button (new task), and rename Later to backlog
* Add option to taskify a tiddler with a button (under the View Toolbar, for example)
** This could be expanded to other things, like linkify, etc
