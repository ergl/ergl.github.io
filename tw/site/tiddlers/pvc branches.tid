!! Current branches

| !Branch | !Desc | !Status |
| pvc |PVC version of Antidote, using a [[client-side coordinator|Client Coordinator Notes]]. See [[notes on the protocol|PVC protocol]]. | Active |
| pvc-newfsm |A new implementation of the base PVC protocol, with a different FSM, and decoupling of the PVC structures from Antidote code. Uses its own ETS tables, virtual nodes, etc. Suffers slowdowns in write-heavy workloads â€” I suspect it has to do with the fact that we're bundling all the state inside the `pvc_storage` virtual node. Maybe split the state. | Research |
| pvc-newfsm-pool |A rebase of `pvc-newfsm`, reimplementing the coordinator pool using poolboy (see [[start transaction issue|start_transaction slowdown rundown]]) | Research |

!! Old/unused branches

| !Branch | !Desc | !Status |
| pvc-noproxy |Rebase of pvc. See [[reasoning and notes on the changes|Noproxy changes]]. | Abandoned |
| pvc-tcp-remote |Rebase of pvc-noproxy. Further read path instrumentation, some clean up. | Abandoned  |
| ergl/refactor-log |Old branch refactoring the replay log | Abandoned |
| master |Tracking `upstream/master`. Not interesting, except for critical bugs | Tracking Upstream |
| master-blotter |Rebase of `upstream/master` adapted to run the blotter benchmark. This means: adding a TCP server, our protobuf library and the built-in driver to handle the messages. Added blotter benchmark as part of the database. Also added benchmark tweaks (CPU pinning, disable key batching, disable `sync_log`) | Stale, used for old comparative benchmarks |
| master-pre-pvc |Historical branch of how `upstream/master` looked like before we started working on pvc. | Comparative perf |
