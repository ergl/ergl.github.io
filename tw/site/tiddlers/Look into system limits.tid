title: Look into system limits
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Number of concurrent connections
** Each client worker thread keeps 4 sockets open (one per cluster node)
** So what's the real number?

* Max Erlang processes (one process per client, maybe we're going overboard).

* Look into ranch concurrent connections

* Kernel limits?

* Erlang TCP options? (backlog, buffer size, etc)
